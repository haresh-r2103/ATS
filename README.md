🚀 Built an AI-Powered ATS Resume Checker!
Excited to share that I’ve developed an ATS Resume Checker powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)! This tool analyzes resumes, checks for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, and provides personalized feedback to improve job application success rates.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ ATS Optimization: Ensures resumes are formatted correctly for Applicant Tracking Systems.
✅ AI-Powered Analysis: Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro to provide detailed feedback.
✅ Keyword Matching: Checks for job-specific keywords to improve ranking.
✅ PDF & Text Support: Processes resumes in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
✅ Instant Feedback: Provides actionable insights on structure, readability, and relevancy.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
🔹 Streamlit – For an interactive web interface.
🔹 Google Gemini API – For LLM-based resume analysis.
🔹 Python (pdf2image, PyMuPDF) – For resume parsing and processing.
🔹 OpenAI/LLM API Integration – For generating resume improvement suggestions.

🌟 Why I Built This?
Many job seekers struggle with ATS rejection due to formatting issues and missing keywords. This tool helps them optimize their resumes, increasing their chances of passing the initial screening!
